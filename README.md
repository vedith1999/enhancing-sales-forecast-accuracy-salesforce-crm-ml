## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

Accurate sales forecasting is central to organizational decision-making and resource planning.  
This project evaluates how **predictive analytics and machine-learning models** (Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM) can improve forecast accuracy within **Salesforce CRM** compared to traditional stage-weighted methods.

The study uses anonymised Salesforce opportunity data combined with macro-level business indicators to train, validate, and benchmark forecasting models.  
Analyses were conducted using **Google Colab (Python)** and **Microsoft Excel (Data Analysis ToolPak)**.

## ðŸ§  Research Objectives

1. **Critically assess** limitations of existing Salesforce forecasting processes at Tech Manufacturing Solutions Ltd. (TMSL) â€” focusing on data, procedural, and behavioural inefficiencies.  
2. **Develop, train, and validate** machine-learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM) using historical CRM and macroeconomic data.  
3. **Benchmark** predictive accuracy against traditional stage-weighted forecasting methods.  
4. **Analyse organisational perceptions** and acceptance of AI-driven forecasting using UTAUT constructs.  
5. **Recommend** ethically grounded, context-specific strategies for sustainable adoption of predictive analytics in CRM operations.
